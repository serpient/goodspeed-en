    <h4>Digital Content</h4>
    <p>
      Whether it’s the Jadeite Cabbage of the National Palace Museum or the
      Classic of Mountains and Seas of the National Central Library, paper copy,
      three-dimensional objects, audio, electronic file or any forms of data, we
      can convert any format to digital format with different forms of
      transcribing, scanning, shooting or recording.

    <h4>Digital Content on Learning Platform</h4>
    <p>
      Instead of relying on professional IT personnel, training in corporations
      and learning platforms of education institutions can now undertake
      self-development and maintenance through structuring digintal content as a
      learning platform.

    <h4>Management of Digital Content Database</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to digital preservation, indigestible files like corporate
      files, public documents, assets records, or national historical files also
      need to establish functions such as index, search, induction, and
      statistics. GoodSpeed offers digital setup in multiple languages such as
      Chinese, English, and Japanese, to broaden user scope and enhance
      international vision.
