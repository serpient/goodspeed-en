      As the trend towards energy saving and carbon reduction, network access
      and network video becomes more and more popular. We provide services to
      convert videos and audio files into online formats. We can upload your
      files to online folders, so you can browse your personal information on
      various computers and Internet-accessible tools.
    </h4>

    <h4>Cloud conversion process</h4>

    <p>
      You only need to pass your file to us! We will take care of it from there
      to transfer the data and attach a special link to you. You can download
      your file directly from this link. After completion, you can choose to ask
      us to return your original file, or delete it.
    </p>

    <h4>About video files:</h4>
    <p>
      You can read your files through your private link. You need a username and
      password to read your data, so the outside world will not be able to view
      your private documents. If you want to read your file, you need to
      download the file from our folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving your file, we will keep your video file for a month.
      Please download your files during this period. Files older than one month
      in our system will be deleted automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need it, we can also reverse this service-you can upload multiple
      file formats to our system, and we will convert you to various types of
      digital formats.
