    <h4>The Application of Microfilm</h4>
    <p>
      The application of microfilm began several decades ago. In those days,
      important government files were preserved in microfilm form. The hardcopy
      was directly photographed to become microfilm. Compared with digital
      files, microfilm can be read with simple equipment and does not require
      lots of hardware and software. Therefore, many public and private
      organizations have hundreds of microfilms stored in appropriate places.

    <h4>What is microfilm?</h4>
    <p>
      Microfilm refers to the process of producing original data such as paper
      files, documents and literature into images on microfilms by reducing
      their size in hundreds of times. Through microfilm image technology,
      original data can be preserved on film, thus the original can stay intact,
      and the authenticity of data is not distorted.
